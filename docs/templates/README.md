# `gh-license`

A GitHub CLI extension to view and generate license files.

All license information is obtained from the GitHub API (https://docs.github.com/en/rest/licenses).

> **NOTE**: The only purpose the CLI serves, is to save you the effort of opening up a browser to copy-&-paste the appropriate LICENSE text. It does NOT provide legal advice and you should still double-check the LICENSE yourself for any errors.
